_an endeavor to die or create_

materializing rhapsody has been probably the most enthralling experience ive ever had. it's an idea that i cant believe nobody else has thought of doing, and so going full speed\*\* ahead on it has kept my mind light and steady for the most part. insomnia is at its endgame with it being almost completely gone. my hopes for rhapsody, if anything, is that it brings people together in a more meaningful way than just a feed. more than just a feed. yeah, thats what social media should be, in my opinion. if you think about the best moments of people getting together in real life, its to share in love of something. whether it be a concert, museum, theatre, there's always an artform at the center like a black hole with people at its event horizon. that is how rhapsody should feel. that is how social media should feel. less a reason for someone to hate themselves, and more a place for someone to share themselves fully through something meaningful.

\*\*full speed should not be taken literally. i dont believe in running faster than you can. at a losers pace is fine, but make sure your stamina is strong as hell.
